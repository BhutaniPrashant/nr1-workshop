## Getting started

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Type the following to confirm that you can run the NR1 CLI `nr1 --version`
3. If you can't run that command, go to the **Build your own application** launcher in New Relic One, register for a developer API key and download the NR1 CLI. See the complete [Setup instructions](../SETUP.md) for more details
4. And if you haven't already cloned the workshop repo, do that now.
